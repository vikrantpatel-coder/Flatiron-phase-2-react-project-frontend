# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## About My App:

My childhood memories inspire this project. Back then we did not have much access to
technology like the current generation. We would play many board games and card games.
Superhero, pokémon, and wrestling card games were some of my favorites. This project reflects the same idea of
playing cards where you shuffle, deploy, and compare the power and most powerful character wins.

Feature Scope:
Filter by: Gender, Alignment, Publisher
